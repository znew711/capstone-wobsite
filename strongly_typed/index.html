									<h2>Meet Lumberjack.</h2>
										<p>Lumberjack is a keylogger that utilizes accelerometer data to recognize and record keystrokes on any keyboard. Small and discreet acceleration sensor undertneath a keyboard send data to a seemingly innocuous receiver plugged into the wall. This processor will use sophisticated machine learning and natural language processing to output keystrokes and complete sentences.</p>

									<h2>Why?</h2>
										<p>In the new age of startups and Silicon Valley entrepreneuring, security is paramount. Pentesters and security contractors make enormous sums of money training employees to avoid phishing, to use secure passwords, and to enforce secure coding practices. However, the idea of physical security is much less emphasized, especially in smaller organizations. Lumberjack attempts to highlight potential physical security flaws and is a tool that thorough pentesters can use to emphasize the idea of physical security. By including physical hardware in our product, we hope that pentesters will be able to get physical access to key machines in an organization to collect all keystrokes at that machine in an undetected manner. This product is incredibly valuable for infiltrating airgapped machines and for gaining initial access to secure networks that sophisticated software-based keyloggers may not be able to infiltrate. Lumberjack's innocuity is an ideal tool for pentesters to teach the value of physical awareness and knowledge of one's surroundings.</p>
										<p>Our eventual goal is to create a counterdefense for Lumberjack that can defeat the accelerometer-based data collection. Creating some program or device that can disrupt the accelerometers via RF signal when one is typing has a major potential as a standard issue for high-security systems. Creating a wireless jammer as a possible method for defeating the system will be an important step to highlighting physical security in all organizations.</p>

									<h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
									</header>
									<h3>Commercial USB Keyloggers</h3>
									<p>USB keyloggers can only be used with USB keyboards, while Lumberjack can be used with any keyboard, including a laptop. Furthermore, an accelerometer pad hidden under a laptop is more subtle and less likely to be detected by an uninformed user, compared to a USB-connected device. Finally, many keyloggers simply store the keystrokes to the device itself, and the device must be physically retrieved. Lumberjack will feature streaming of the keystrokes, utilizing Wi-Fi and a virtual file system to enable remote access of the keystroke data. Thus, Lumberjack will never need to be physically retrieved and will allow the keystrokes to be viewed in near-real time.</p>
									<h3>Acoustic Data Based Keyloggers</h3> 
									<p>Much research has been conducted on keyloggers that utilize acoustic data, using the differing tones of keystrokes to classify which key is being pressed. Unlike acoustic keyloggers, our product could be used in a variety of settings, including commonly noisy ones. Accelerometer data is prone to less outside interference, and its accuracy should have little variance based on location. </p>
									<h3>Phone Gyroscope Based Keyloggers</h3>
									<p>In 2011, researchers at Georgia Tech published preliminary research showing how a hijacked phone sitting near a keyboard could pick up distinct keystrokes using the phone's accelerometer. The researchers were able to get an impressive 80% accuracy just by using an iPhone several inches away. Lumberjack's data will come from directly beneath the keyboard rather than from a nearby phone and thus will have better accuracy of detected keystrokes. Plus, by bypassing the need for a phone, an attacker or pentester need not create a rootkit for the phone of their target. One only needs physical access once in order to begin collecting accurate keystroke data.</p>
